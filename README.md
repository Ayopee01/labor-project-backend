# Backend API Structure

Backend Express API for labor/user management.

The project supports two development modes:

- Local development on a developer machine
- Shared development/test deployment on a self-managed DigitalOcean Droplet — the same droplet
  also runs production; see **Deploying to DigitalOcean** below. There is no separate hosted
  environment for dev/test.

The shared droplet deployment provides a single public Backend Base URL for:

- Frontend integration
- Postman testing
- LINE OA webhook testing
- WebSocket testing
- Integration testing

Prisma owns the PostgreSQL schema, migrations, seed, and database client.

## API Documentation

(nginx/TLS termination is configured directly on the droplet, outside this repo — see **Deploying to DigitalOcean** below.)

## Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Redis / Redis-compatible Key Value
- BullMQ
- Prisma ORM
- TypeScript compiled to CommonJS
- Docker
- GitHub Actions CI
- DigitalOcean Droplet (self-managed, Docker Compose) for both production and shared dev/test deployment — nginx/TLS is configured directly on the host, outside Docker Compose

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the token secrets (`JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `JWT_LOGIN_CHALLENGE_SECRET`, `VENDOR_ACTION_TOKEN_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_HASH_SECRET`) with any local values.

### 3. Start PostgreSQL and Redis

Redis is required for the app to start (BullMQ/ioredis). PostgreSQL can either run in Docker or be an existing local install.

**Option A — Postgres + Redis in Docker (no local Postgres install needed):**

```bash
docker compose --profile local-db up -d postgres redis
```

> The compose `postgres` service binds to host port `5434` by default, while `.env.example`'s `DATABASE_URL` points at port `5433`. Either add `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT=5433` to your `.env`, or change `DATABASE_URL`'s port to `5434` to match.

**Option B — Use an existing local PostgreSQL install:**

```bash
npm run docker:redis
```

Point `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` at your local PostgreSQL instance.

### 4. Generate the Prisma client and apply migrations

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

### 5. Seed initial data

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This creates the initial admin account and master data required to log in.

### 6. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:8080` (from `PORT` in `.env`), with Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/api-docs`.

### Alternative: run the API itself in Docker too

`npm run docker:up` (`docker compose up --build`) builds and runs the `api` and `redis` services. By default it expects PostgreSQL to be reachable from inside the container via `DOCKER_DATABASE_URL` (defaults to `host.docker.internal:5433`, i.e. a PostgreSQL instance running on your host machine). To also run PostgreSQL in Docker, use `docker compose --profile local-db up --build` instead and set `DOCKER_DATABASE_URL` to `postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/labor_project`.

The `api` container runs `npm run db:generate` automatically on startup, but migrations and seeding still need to be run manually, e.g.:

```bash
docker compose exec api npm run db:migrate
docker compose exec api npm run db:seed
```

`docker-compose.yml` also has an `api-prod` service (gated behind the `production` profile) for self-managed production deployments — it builds the `production` Docker target instead of `dev`, runs the compiled `dist/` build with no source bind-mount, and sets `NODE_ENV=production` correctly. It is not used for local development; see the log stack section below for how it's typically started together with logging.

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Runs unit tests and route tests (`test:unit` + `test:routes`). `npm run test:integration` additionally requires a real, isolated test database — `DATABASE_URL` must include `test` in its name (enforced in `test/setup/test-env.ts`).

## Logging & Error Tracking

Every request is logged once it completes, as a single structured JSON line to stdout (via [pino](https://getpino.io)) — never to a local file, so Promtail can ship it straight off the Docker log driver (see the self-hosted log stack section below) with no app-side log file to manage. Fields logged per request:

- `requestId` — from the inbound `X-Request-Id` header, or a generated UUID if not sent. Always echoed back in the `X-Request-Id` response header, and included in every error response body so a user can report an issue and the team can find the matching log line fast.
- `method`, `path`, `statusCode`, `durationMs`
- `clientType` — `worker_app` / `admin_webapp` / `driver_webapp` / `gate` / `line_oa` / `unknown`, detected from the URL path prefix first, then (for the shared `/api/auth` routes only) from the authenticated account's role, then from an `X-Client-Type` header, then `unknown` — see `src/utils/client-type.ts`
- `clientVersion` — from an optional `X-Client-Version` header
- `userId` — the authenticated account id, when present
- `ip`

Log level follows the response status code: `>=500` → `error`, `>=400` → `warn`, otherwise → `info`.

**Sensitive data**: passwords, tokens, secrets, and `Authorization` headers are redacted (`[REDACTED]`) before anything is logged, via `src/utils/logger.ts`'s `redact()` — this applies to every `logger.*` call in the codebase, including the 5xx error log's request body, so this never needs to be handled per-endpoint.

**5xx errors** additionally log full context (`requestId`, `path`, `userId`, `clientType`, the redacted request body, stack trace) and are reported to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) with the same `requestId`/`clientType`/`userId` attached as tags/user context (`src/middlewares/error.middleware.ts`). Sentry is a no-op until `SENTRY_DSN` is set.

**Viewing logs**: `docker compose logs -f api-prod` on the droplet shows raw JSON lines directly; every line is a JSON object, filter/search by any field above (e.g. `requestId` from an error response, or `clientType`). For a searchable UI across history instead of tailing raw output, use Grafana + Loki — see **Self-Hosted Log Stack** below.

**Configuring Sentry**: set `SENTRY_DSN` in `.env` (see `.env.example`) — a no-op until set.

In local development (`NODE_ENV=development`), logs are pretty-printed via `pino-pretty` instead of raw JSON.

## Self-Hosted Log Stack (Grafana + Loki + Promtail)

For a self-managed deployment (e.g. a DigitalOcean droplet) without an external log service, `docker-compose.yml` includes a self-hosted log stack gated behind the `logging` profile, so it never affects local development (plain `docker compose up` is unchanged). Promtail reads the `api`/`api-prod` container's stdout JSON logs directly through the Docker logging driver (no app-side changes, no extra log file mounts) and ships them to Loki; Grafana comes with Loki pre-provisioned as a data source.

**Starting it** (alongside the production API — see `docker-compose.yml`'s `api-prod` service, gated behind the `production` profile for the same reason):

```bash
GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER=admin GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<a-real-password> \
  docker compose --profile production --profile logging up -d redis api-prod loki promtail grafana
```

> **List the service names explicitly, as above — do not run a bare `docker compose --profile production --profile logging up -d` with no service names.** Both `api` (the local-dev service, unprofiled and therefore always eligible to start) and `api-prod` bind the same host port `8080`, so an unnamed `up` would try to start both and fail on a port conflict. Naming services explicitly (as above) starts only what's listed and skips `api` entirely — verified by actually running this on this exact `docker-compose.yml`.

(or set `GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER`/`GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the droplet's `.env` instead of inline — see `.env.example`.) If left unset, Grafana falls back to its own insecure `admin`/`admin` default — always set a real password before exposing the port below.

Also add `postgres` to that service list if this droplet also runs PostgreSQL in Docker (i.e. you're additionally using the `local-db` profile from the Local Development Setup section above) — it isn't included by default here since many production setups instead point `DATABASE_URL` at an external managed Postgres.

**Viewing logs**: open `http://<droplet-ip>:3000`, log in with the admin credentials above, then **Explore** → **Loki** → query e.g. `{service="api-prod"}` (or `{service="api"}` if you're pointed at a local-dev container instead).

**Restrict Grafana's port to your team only (required before exposing it on a public host)** — the admin password is the only auth layer in front of port 3000, so also firewall it at the OS level with UFW on the droplet itself. This is a **manual command you run yourself directly on the droplet, once** — it is not part of `docker-compose.yml` and nothing in this repo runs it automatically:

```bash
# 1. Replace YOUR_TEAM_IP with your actual team IP(s)/CIDR first — this is a placeholder.
# 2. Run these ONE AT A TIME and check you're not locked out after each step, in this exact
#    order. Getting the order wrong (e.g. enabling UFW or denying a port before explicitly
#    allowing SSH) can lock you out of the droplet entirely, with no way back in except the
#    provider's web console.
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp                                          # SSH — do this first, always
sudo ufw allow from YOUR_TEAM_IP to any port 3000 proto tcp     # Grafana, team IP only
sudo ufw deny 3000/tcp                                          # Grafana, deny everyone else
sudo ufw enable                                                 # only enable after the rules above
sudo ufw status verbose                                         # confirm SSH (22) is allowed before disconnecting
```

**Retention**: Loki is configured for 14 days (`monitoring/loki-config.yaml`'s `retention_period`) — set conservatively because the droplet's disk size wasn't known at setup time. Once real disk usage is confirmed comfortable (check with `docker exec labor-loki du -sh /loki` after the stack has been running a while), this can be raised to 30 days by editing that one value and restarting the `loki` container — no data migration needed. Consider also enabling DigitalOcean's built-in Droplet disk-usage monitoring/alerts as a safety net independent of Loki's own retention.

**Backup**: this is a self-managed VM — there is no automatic backup of the `loki_data` volume the way a managed logging service would provide. Back it up periodically (e.g. `docker run --rm -v labor-project-backend_loki_data:/loki -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/loki-backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz /loki`) if historical logs need to survive a lost/corrupted droplet, or treat log history as disposable if it doesn't.

## Deploying to DigitalOcean (self-managed droplet)

This is the only deployment target for the project — the same droplet serves both production and the shared dev/test environment described at the top of this README (a second droplet, if the team wants environments physically separated, would just repeat these same steps). It runs the `api-prod` and (optionally) `postgres`/log-stack services from `docker-compose.yml` via Docker Compose, on a DigitalOcean Droplet (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS). nginx and TLS (Let's Encrypt or otherwise) are set up directly on the host, outside this repo — `api-prod` just listens on port 8080 for whatever reverse proxy you put in front of it.

### 1. Provision the droplet and install Docker

- Create the droplet (2 vCPU/4GB is the tested baseline), SSH in.
- Install Docker Engine + the Compose plugin (see Docker's official install docs for Ubuntu).
- `git clone` this repo onto the droplet.

### 2. Configure `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in every `CHANGE_ME*` placeholder — see the **Pre-deploy secret checklist** below.

### 3. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose --profile production up -d redis api-prod
```

To also run PostgreSQL in Docker on this droplet instead of an external managed database, add `postgres` to the service list and the `local-db` profile, e.g. `docker compose --profile production --profile local-db up -d redis postgres api-prod`.

For the optional log stack (Grafana + Loki + Promtail), see the **Self-Hosted Log Stack** section above — it's the same `--profile production --profile logging` pattern.

### 4. Set up nginx + HTTPS on the host

nginx and TLS are managed directly on the droplet (outside Docker Compose) — set up nginx as a reverse proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080` (where `api-prod` listens) and obtain a certificate (e.g. via `certbot --nginx`) however fits your setup.

### 5. Verify

- `curl https://<your-domain>/ready` should return healthy.
- `docker compose ps` — all expected services `Up`/healthy.

### 6. Set up CI/CD auto-deploy (optional)

Once the droplet is up and steps 1–5 above have been done manually at least once, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` can deploy every subsequent push to `main` automatically: after the existing build/test job passes, a `deploy` job SSHes into the droplet, fast-forwards the existing git checkout to `origin/main`, and restarts the production containers with a fresh build (`docker compose --profile production up -d --build redis api-prod`). It only runs on `push` to `main` (not on pull requests, and not on `develop`), and only after `build-test` succeeds.

Set these **GitHub repository secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) for it to work:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_HOST` | The droplet's IP address (or domain) |
| `DEPLOY_USER` | SSH user on the droplet (a dedicated deploy user is preferable to a personal login) |
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | The **private** key for a dedicated deploy key pair — generate one just for this (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f deploy_key -N ""`), add `deploy_key.pub` to that user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the droplet, and paste the contents of `deploy_key` (the private half) into this secret. Never reuse a personal SSH key here. |
| `DEPLOY_PATH` | Absolute path to this repo's git clone on the droplet (e.g. `/home/deploy/labor-project-backend`) |
| `DEPLOY_PORT` | Optional — only needed if SSH runs on a non-default port |

`git reset --hard origin/main` runs as part of the deploy step — safe because `.env` is gitignored (never touched by it) and the deploy path is expected to only ever be updated by this job, not edited by hand on the droplet.

Without these secrets set, the `deploy` job simply fails on every push to `main` (the rest of CI — typecheck/build/tests — is unaffected); leave them unset if auto-deploy isn't wanted yet and keep deploying manually via steps 1–5.

### UFW firewall

Same manual, one-command-at-a-time caution as the Grafana section above — **always allow SSH before enabling UFW**, or you can be locked out with no way back in except the provider's web console:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp     # SSH — do this first, always
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp     # host nginx: HTTP (redirects to HTTPS, also serves the ACME challenge)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp    # host nginx: HTTPS
sudo ufw enable           # only enable after the rules above
sudo ufw status verbose   # confirm SSH (22) is allowed before disconnecting
```

Port 3000 (Grafana) is deliberately **not** opened here — see the UFW rule in the log-stack section above, which restricts it to your team's IP(s) only. Postgres/Redis ports are not exposed publicly at all in `docker-compose.yml`'s production services.

### Database backups

`scripts/backup-postgres.sh` dumps the database with `pg_dump`, gzips it, uploads it to a DigitalOcean Spaces bucket (S3-compatible), and prunes backups older than `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` from that bucket. Configure it entirely through the `SPACES_*` variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`) — no credentials are ever hardcoded in the script.

Install its dependencies once on the droplet:

```bash
sudo apt install -y postgresql-client s3cmd
```

Run it manually to test:

```bash
./scripts/backup-postgres.sh
```

**Cron** (every 6 hours, logging to a file so failures are visible):

```bash
crontab -e
# add:
0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/labor-project-backend && ./scripts/backup-postgres.sh >> /var/log/labor-backup.log 2>&1
```

**`loki_data` and whole-droplet safety net**: rather than a separate cron job, enable DigitalOcean's built-in **automatic daily Droplet snapshots** (Droplet → Backups, in the DigitalOcean control panel) — this covers `loki_data` and every other volume/file on the droplet as a single daily point-in-time image, independent of anything in this repo.

### Pre-deploy secret checklist

Before starting the stack in production, replace every one of these in `.env` (all currently `CHANGE_ME*` placeholders in `.env.example`):

- `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `JWT_LOGIN_CHALLENGE_SECRET`, `VENDOR_ACTION_TOKEN_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_HASH_SECRET` — generate each separately: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `DOCKER_DATABASE_URL` (and `DATABASE_URL` if used directly) — replace the `password` placeholder with a real generated password
- `CORS_ORIGIN` — the real frontend origin(s), not `*`
- `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — required before exposing port 3000, even behind the UFW team-IP rule above
- `SPACES_ENDPOINT`, `SPACES_REGION`, `SPACES_ACCESS_KEY`, `SPACES_SECRET_KEY` — from the DigitalOcean control panel (API → Spaces Keys); required for the app to start at all (admin profile image uploads)
- `SPACES_ADMIN_BUCKET` — a public-read Spaces bucket for admin profile images (separate from the private backup bucket below)
- `SPACES_BUCKET` — a private Spaces bucket for `scripts/backup-postgres.sh` database backups
- `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` — from the LINE Developers console
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` — from the Firebase service account JSON
- `SENTRY_DSN` — optional; leave empty to keep Sentry disabled
